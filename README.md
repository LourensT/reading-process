# Visualizing my progress in individual books

Data Source: I log progress manually in my notes app and then I put it on google sheets 

Visualization Tool: Python 3.6 with matplotlib

Beginning 2018, I wanted to take reading a bit more serious, and to motivate myself, I'd log my progress (don't ask me why, but it worked). At the end of 2018 I then wrote some code to make some visualizations out of it. I continued reading and logging my progress, so at the end of 2019 I reworked some of the code with the goal of making this tool a bit more dynamic for years to come.

# Reading per year

* In 2018 I read 25 books, (7645 pages, 305 page average per book, 14 days average per book). I added some events in my personal life in the timeline to give context for my reading habits. I posted this on /r/dataisbeautiful as well https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ad9vut/oc_is_it_too_late_to_post_2018_recaps_well_either/

* In 2019 I read 36 books, (12145 pages, 328.24 page average per book, 11.76 days average per book).

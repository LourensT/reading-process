In 2018 I started taking reading a bit more serious, and to motivate myself, I'd log my progress (don't ask me why, but it worked).
In 2018 I read 25 books, (7645 pages, 305 page average per book, 14 days average per book). I added some events in my personal life in the timeline to give context for my reading habits. 

Curious what you all think and interested in suggestions!

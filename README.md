# Visualizing my progress in individual books

Data Source: I log progress manually in my notes app and then I put it on google sheets 

Visualization Tool: Python 3.6 with matplotlib

Beginning 2018, I wanted to take reading a bit more serious, and to motivate myself, I'd log my progress (don't ask me why, but it worked). At the end of 2018 I then wrote some code to make some visualizations out of it. I continued reading and logging my progress, so at the end of 2019 I reworked some of the code with the goal of making this tool a bit more dynamic for years to come.
